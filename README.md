harpbp-sheetsee
===============

A clone of [jlord's sheetsee fork n go project](http://jlord.us/fork-n-go/) for the harp platform. Build static sites with dynamic data powered by a Google Spreadsheet.

To create an instance of this site for yourself all you need to do:

Create a Google spreadsheet with the same headers (just copy and paste header row from [the original](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao5u1U6KYND7dFVkcnJRNUtHWUNKamxoRGg4ZzNiT3c#gid=0)).

Edit harp.json with your spreadsheet key.
